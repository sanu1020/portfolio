Hold the power button for about 15 seconds to power the device back onâ€“which will be evident once the Apple logo appears. If the device is an iPhone 6, 7, 8 or SE, hold the side button until the power off slider appears and power off the phone, and hold that same button for at least five seconds until the Apple logo appears to power the iPhone back on."
